## Course Overview ðŸ“š

System Identification is a fascinating discipline that plays a crucial role in engineering and data analysis. It focuses on constructing mathematical models to understand and predict the behavior of complex systems. Throughout this course, we will delve into various topics, including time-domain and frequency-domain identification methods, parametric and non-parametric modeling, and model validation. Our esteemed instructor, Professor Hamid Khaloozadeh, from the Department of Systems and Control, K.N. Toosi University of Technology, will guide us through this intriguing journey.
